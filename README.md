### Enigma Machine, but now with three rotors! And no plugs.

Hello! After watching Computerphile video about Enigma Machine, i've tried to make one. It had only one rotor and no plug, but now there's three rotors. I've tried my best and it was really fun. Enjoy using/modifying/taking a look at it! :D

By the way, if you want you can run the program on your computer. All you have to do is have python your pc and install [coloroma](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/). To do that, run in your command prompt the following command:

 ```pip install colorama```

 And done! Now, download the archive, run and see it with some nice colors in your command prompt. :')
